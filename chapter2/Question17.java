/*
 * (Science: wind-chill temperature) How cold is it outside? The temperature alone is
 * not enough to provide the answer. Other factors including wind speed, relative humidity,
 * and sunshine play important roles in determining coldness outside. In 2001, the National 
 * Weather Service (NWS) implemented the new wind-chill temperature to measure the coldness 
 * using temperature and wind speed. The formula is t_wc = 35.74 + 0.6215t_a - 35.75v^0.16 + 0.4275t_av^0.16
 * where ta is the outside temperature measured in degrees Fahrenheit, v is the speed
 * measured in miles per hour, and twc is the wind-chill temperature. The formula cannot
 * be used for wind speeds below 2 mph or temperatures below -58°F or above 41°F.
 * 
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature between -58°F
 * and 41°F and a wind speed greater than or equal to 2 then displays the wind-chill
 * temperature. Use Math.pow(a, b) to compute v0.16. Here is a sample run:
 * 
 * Enter the temperature in Fahrenheit between -58°F and 41°F: 5.3
 * Enter the wind speed (>= 2) in miles per hour: 6
 * The wind chill index is -5.56707

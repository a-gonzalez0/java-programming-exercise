/*
 * (Algebra: solve quadratic equations) The two roots of a quadratic equation
 * ax^2 + bx + c = 0 can be obtained using the following formula:
 * r1 = -b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) / 2a 
 * and r2 = -b - sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) / 2a
 * 
 * b^2 - 4ac is called the discriminant of the quadratic equation. If it is positive, the
 * equation has two real roots. If it is zero, the equation has one root. If it is negative, 
 * the equation has no real roots.
 * 
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter values for a, b, and c and displays
 * the result based on the discriminant. If the discriminant is positive, display two
 * roots. If the discriminant is 0, display one root. Otherwise, display “The equation
 * has no real roots.”
 * 
 * Note you can use Math.pow(x, 0.5) to compute 2x. Here are some sample
 * runs:
 * 
 * Enter a, b, c: 1.0 3 1
 * The equation has two roots -0.381966 and -2.61803
 * 
 * Enter a, b, c: 1 2.0 1
 * The equation has one root -1.0
 * 
 * Enter a, b, c: 1 2 3
 * The equation has no real roots

 * (Random points on a circle) Write a program that generates three random points
 * on a circle centered at (0, 0) with radius 40 and displays three angles in a triangle
 * formed by these three points, as shown in Figure 4.4a. Display the angles in
 * degrees. (Hint: Generate a random angle a in radians between 0 and 2pi, as shown
 * in Figure 4.4b and the point determined by this angle is 
 * Math.pow(r, x) * Math.cos(a), Math.pow(r, x) * Math.sin(a).)
